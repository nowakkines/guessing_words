The program makes a word, and the user has to guess it.

<p1>Project description: the program makes a word, and the user has to guess it. Initially, all letters of the word are unknown. A gallows with a noose is also drawn. The user suggests a letter that can be included in this word. If there is such a letter in the word, then the program puts the letter as many times as it occurs in the word. If there is no such letter, a circle in a loop representing a head is added to the gallows. The user continues to guess the letters until he guesses the whole word. For each unsuccessful attempt, another part of the hangman's torso is added (usually there are 6 of them: head, torso, 2 arms and 2 legs.</p1>
